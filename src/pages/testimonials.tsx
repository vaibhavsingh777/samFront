      "Student Alumni Meet (SAM) organised in Pune by the Student Alumni Relations Cell (SARC), was truly  a memorable experience for me. I got a chance to meet the alumni of IITB even before I stepped on our campus. The alums shared stories from their time at IITB and gave us tips on making friends and balancing studies with fun activities.The alumni talked about how important it is to make friends and build memories during our time at IITB. They also encouraged us to explore our interests beyond academics. The event ended with alumni sharing their career journeys, offering us advice, and reminding us of the strong IITB network. It was an inspiring and motivating day, making me feel proud and excited to be part of the IITB community!",

The event was a wonderful opportunity for upcoming freshers to meet and interact with the alumni of IIT Bombay.The atmosphere was warm and welcoming, with a cozy setting that made it easy for everyone to mingle and have meaningful conversations. The host was gracious and ensured that everyone felt at home.The meetup itself was incredibly beneficial. It allowed the freshers to gain valuable insights and advice from the alumni, who shared their experiences and offered guidance on how to navigate the academic and social aspects of life at IIT Bombay.

      "I arrived at the 'Ideas to Impact Hub' in Pune for the IITB Student Alumni Meet (SAM). Surprisingly early, I met alumni from the 1980s. They welcomed me warmly, reminiscing about their IITB days. Over breakfast, we shared storiesâ€”alumni pride, hostel memories, and the changing times at IITB. They emphasized lifelong friendships, the evolving campus, and the importance of non-academic experiences. Discussions ranged from ragging to career advice, highlighting IITB's strong alumni network and global reputation. It was an inspiring start to my IITB journey!",
