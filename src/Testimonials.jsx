I got a chance to meet the alumni of IITB even before I stepped on our campus. The alums shared stories from their time at IITB and gave us tips on making friends and balancing studies with fun activities.The alumni talked about how important it is to make friends and build memories during our time at IITB. They also encouraged us to explore our interests beyond academics. The event ended with alumni sharing their career journeys, offering us advice, and reminding us of the strong IITB network.

      content: "I arrived at the 'Ideas to Impact Hub' in Pune for the IITB Student Alumni Meet (SAM). Surprisingly early, I met alumni from the 1980s. They welcomed me warmly, reminiscing about their IITB days. Over breakfast, we shared storiesâ€”alumni pride, hostel memories, and the changing times at IITB. They emphasized lifelong friendships, the evolving campus, and the importance of non-academic experiences. Discussions ranged from ragging to career advice, highlighting IITB's strong alumni network and global reputation. It was an inspiring start to my IITB journey!
