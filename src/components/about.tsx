        The Student Alumni Meet in the city is aimed to be a welcome event for
        IITB students. It is an opportunity for them to get guidance from the
        alumni of IIT Bombay. It will be an event where they will get to know
        what life looks like after getting out of IIT and also what is the
        current scenario of life in the institute from the experiences of our
        esteemed alumni and the current students (our team), respectively.
